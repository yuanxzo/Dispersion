# **Dispersion**  v1.0
**This module is used to calculate Rayleigh surface wave dispersion curve and dispersion function value and other related content.**

## Introduction
1. This module contains three forward algorithms:
    - Fast vector-transfer algorithm, corresponding to the prefix of program name: FVTA,
    - Generalized reflection and transmission coefficient algorithm, corresponding to the prefix of program name: GRTA,
    - Modified Thomson-Haskell algorithm，corresponding to the prefix of program name：Haskell.
    
    But only FVTA can be used to get the complete Rayleigh wave dispersion curves.
    
2. This module contains the following subroutines:
