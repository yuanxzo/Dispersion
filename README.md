# **Dispersion**
**This module is used to calculate Rayleigh surface wave dispersion curve and dispersion function value and other related content.**

## Introduction
1. This module contains two forward algorithms:
    - Fast vector-transfer algorithm, corresponding to the prefix of program name: FVTA,
    - Generalized reflection and transmission coefficient algorithm, corresponding prefix: GRTA.

    But only FVTA can be used to get the complete Rayleigh wave dispersion curves.
